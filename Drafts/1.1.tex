\begin{problem}{1}
(a) (probability that the total after rolling 4 fair dice is 21) \underline{\hspace{1cm}}
(probability that the total after rolling 4 fair dice is 22)
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}[Solution]

(probability that the total after rolling 4 fair dice is 21) $>$
(probability that the total after rolling 4 fair dice is 22)
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Explanation]

The expected value of the total after rolling one fair die is $21 / 6 = 3.5$. The expected value of the total after rolling four fair dice is thus $3.5 \times 4 = 14$. Since 21 is closer to the expected value than 22, it is the more probable roll.
\end{proof}
